Description: Extends the 'survey' package to provides functions to estimate incidence and
    prevalence from the results of assay-based recent infection testing algorithms
    (RITA) measured in complex household surveys, with standard errors estimated via
    Taylor Linearization. The incidence estimator is proposed by Kassanjee et al.
    (2012) and uncertainty about mean duration of recent infection (MDRI) and false
    recency rate (FRR) follow the heuristic approach proposed by Kassanjee et al.
